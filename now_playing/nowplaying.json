It’s a movie for everyone who wakes up each day and continues to put one foot in front of other—laughing often, crying often, watching as many beautiful films and sports games as possible, aimlessly walking the city streets alone, making art, hanging with good friends—but ultimately doesn’t understand what the fuck is going on anymore.",

Indebted to the spirits of Larry Cohen, Anne Charlotte Robertson, and New York City herself, IN SEARCH OF GLADYS GLOVER is a time-shifting journey about the disorienting feeling of being in the city the past few years. It’s a movie for everyone who wakes up each day and continues to put one foot in front of other—laughing often, crying often, watching as many beautiful films and sports games as possible, aimlessly walking the city streets alone, making art, hanging with good friends—but ultimately doesn’t understand what the fuck is going on anymore.",

Luckily for Ava, however, her two best friends, Willow (Sophia Scott) and Ethan (Benno Hennig), are with her every step of the way… that is until an impromptu student body election ends up pitting Ava against Willow, with poor Ethan stuck in the middle. Through her adventure, Ava has to grapple with the opinions of those around her: a local business owner and classmate who struggles with human interaction (Anna Lupien), a people pleasing young teacher (Ben Hauptman), a doubtful and pessimistic principal (Tim Cunningham), and a mother who can never find the right words to say (Nanette Hennig Fraser). Ava will learn that becoming her own person is not just about stepping out of someone’s shadow, but about making hard choices even when you see no light at the end of the tunnel.",
